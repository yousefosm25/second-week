 In the Database Design Course video, the instructor explains the concepts of one-to-one and many-to-many relationships in database design using examples of classes and students, user accounts, and credit cards. One-to-one relationships, such as between a user and a card, are illustrated by having the username as an attribute of the account table. However, for many-to-many relationships, like classes and students, the instructor suggests creating an intermediary table to efficiently manage the data. The instructor emphasizes the importance of proper database design and using primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables. The video covers both one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, with examples of a shopping website and a college class scenario. The instructor also touches upon the challenges of managing many-to-many relationships and the benefits of using an intermediary table as a solution.
 In the Database Design Course video, the importance of unique and never-changing keys in database design is emphasized. Keys serve as the foundation for structuring the entire database and act as an index for efficient data retrieval. The instructor recommends using unique usernames as keys and avoiding keys that can change or be empty. The concept of keys and indexes is further explained, with keys being used for SQL queries, SELECT statements, and joins to link tables and improve database performance. The creation of a membership status table and the use of foreign keys to establish a connection between membership and member tables is also discussed, along with the benefits of maintaining data integrity and eliminating repetition. The instructor introduces advanced concepts such as super keys and candidate keys, which ensure uniqueness in a database, and explains the process of choosing a primary key for a database. Natural keys, derived from the data being stored, and surrogate keys, added specifically for the purpose of serving as a primary key, are also introduced.
